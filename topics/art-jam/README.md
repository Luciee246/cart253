## Description

> *My awesome self-portrait* is an interactive artwork that allows the user to move my favourite object, a microphone, closer to or farther from me.

> The experience is controlled via the mouse. Bring the microphone closer to my mouth and I will prepare to sing, and vice-versa!

I used the text function, which I never used, to write "Music is like oxygen to me"
