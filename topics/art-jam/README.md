## Description

This description should help the reader understand what the program is, anything they should know to be able to experience it (controls, special features, etc.), and what the desired user experience is. For example:

> *My awesome self-portrait* is an interactive artwork that allows the user to move my favourite object, a microphone, closer to or farther from me.

> The experience is controlled via the mouse. Bring the microphone closer to my mouth and I will prepare to sing, and vice-versa!
