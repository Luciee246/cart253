## Description

> *My awesome self-portrait* is an interactive artwork that allows the user to move my favourite object, a microphone, closer to or farther from me.

> The experience is controlled via the mouse. Click on the screen before interacting. Bring the microphone closer to my mouth and I will start to sing, and vice-versa!

I used the text function, which I never used, to write an iconic Elvis quote. If you don't know what this references, please search up the quote on YouTube. It is very funny.
I also added a sound that fades in and out depending on the distance of the microphone, and it plays my song!! Shameless plug, but it's called "With you" and it's out everywhere!
