## Description

> *Hockey Master* is a simulator experience that allows the user to control a puck and push it to the goal.

> The experience is controlled via mouse movement, with the user moving the puck and getting it to goal, and you play for a duratino of 10 seconds.

> This project is heavily influenced by the Montreal Canadiens (the best team), have your sound on!

> Three variations:
> - Normal: Get the puck to the goal as many times as you can!
> - Opposite: 
> - Music will guide you: The target can only be found by listening to the music that plays louder when you get closer to it (hot/cold style)
