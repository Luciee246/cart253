THIS IS SO COOL.

I was a bit confused at first since the only movable object was the hair, but that was because the frame that contained the hair was covering the other movable objects. You can only move the eyes, nose, mouth, and body if you move the hair completely away from everything else.

The coding is EXTREMELY well organized and clear. I was able to understand everything you did because of the comments, and that's what made me realize that every object is supposed to move, not just the hair.

I really like the idea of moving different objects around and having the user control what the character looks like. I think it would be super cool to have multiple different objects to choose from to make the character look different.

This is a very cool project, and I had a lot of fun moving everything around to make funny faces :)
