THIS IS SO COOL.

I was a bit confused at first since the only movable object was the hair, but that was because the frame that contained the hair was covering the other movable objects. You can only move the eyes, nose, mouth, and body if you move the hair completely away from everything else.

The coding is EXTREMELY well organized and clear. I was able to understand everything you did because of the comments, and that's what made me realize that every object is supposed to move, not just the hair.

I really like the idea of moving different objects around and having the user control what the character looks like. I think it would be super cool to have multiple different objects to choose from to make the character look different.

This is a very cool project, and I had a lot of fun moving everything around to make funny faces :)

The use of pixel art is super cool, and it looks pretty hard to do. It’s very impressive!

The coding could be a little more organized. It would be great if there were comments for every line; at the very least, it would be easier to understand if each line had an explanation as to what it does. The main problem is that “TILE_SIZE” is everywhere, when all of those could be put as a function call, and could be called on by using “let”.

I really like the pixel art, it’s honestly very impressive. The use of the grid looks like a math notebook that you doodled in; it’s pretty relatable. The shading adds a lot to the artwork, the 3d aspect makes it look like a video game character!

It would be cool if the mouse could control the eyes in a circular motion. Instead of just having the eyes move left and center, they could move in a circle depending on where the mouse is.

This was super fun to interact with! I moved my cursor really fast on the screen to make the eyes go crazy. It was funny :)
