- Frog changes colors (every 10 flies eaten changes the frogs color, starts green, gets darker until black)

- Frog accuracy worsens over time (maybe tongue gets skinnier also every 10 flies eaten?)

- 3 strikes you're out (maybe you could lose a strike if you eat 5 flies in a row?)

- Flies come in different sizes (some are bigger/smaller than others)

- More and more flies appear instead of just 1 every time (same premise for fireflies)

- Flies or fireflies? (fireflies are toxic to frogs, flies and fireflies will appear, you could get a strike if you eat the latter)

- Frog pause (don't move the cursor too fast or else the frog will get dizzy, 3 sec cooldown, meanwhile you could get a strike if a fly gets away)

- Sky gets darker over time, game gets harder (more and more fireflies as the game goes on)

- Frog gets bigger (you win once the frog takes up the screen)

- Powerups! (One that removes your strikes, one that freezes the flies on your screen so you could get them all)

- Tongue follows the original target (if I move the frog body, the tongue should stay where I originally hit. The tongue would come back like an angle)
