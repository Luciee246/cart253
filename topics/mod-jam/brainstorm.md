- Frog changes colors (every 10 flies eaten changes the frogs color, starts green, gets darker until black)

- Frog accuracy worsens over time (maybe tongue gets skinnier also every 10 flies eaten?)

- 3 strikes you're out (maybe you could lose a strike if you eat 5 flies in a row?)

- Flies come in different sizes (some are bigger/smaller than others)

- Flies or fireflies? (fireflies are toxic to frogs, flies and fireflies will appear, you could get a strike if you eat the latter)

- More and more flies appear instead of just 1 every time (same premise for fireflies)

- Frog pause (don't move the cursor too fast or else the frog will get dizzy, 3 sec cooldown, meanwhile you could get a strike if a fly gets away)

- Sky gets darker over time, game gets harder (more and more fireflies as the game goes on)

- Frog gets bigger (you win once the frog takes up the screen)

- Powerups! (One that removes your strikes, one that freezes the flies on your screen so you could get them all)

- Tongue follows the original target (if I move the frog body, the tongue should stay where I originally hit. The tongue would come back like an angle)

- Intro screen tongue clicks (click start for example, the tongue comes up and clicks it for you)

- Different speeds (Flies move a bit slower than fireflies)

- Gamemodes (timer as gameplay option, strike as another)

- Timer gamemode (1 min timer, lose 10 sec everytime you hit a firefly. Immediate hard mode, since you only have a minute)

- A little hat! (Give the forg a hat! Maybe have multiple hats to choose from!)

- Flies say something ("ow" when they're eaten, "HAHA" when they're not. HAHA from Nelson Muntz)

- Secret achievements? (Catch 10 flies in a row for "Master-catcher", touch nothing and get 3 strikes for "Are you there?")

- Flies come from both directions (different speeds too?)

- Fun fact when lose (A fun fact about frogs appears when you lose, so at least you learn something)
