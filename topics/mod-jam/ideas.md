# Top ideas

- Start game: Frog tongue clicks "start"

- 3 strikes you're out (maybe you could lose a strike if you eat 5 flies in a row?)

- Flies or fireflies? (fireflies are toxic to frogs, flies and fireflies will appear, you could get a strike if you eat the latter)

- More and more flies appear over time instead of just 1 every time (same premise for fireflies)

- Sky gets darker over time, game gets harder (more and more fireflies as the game goes on)

- A little hat! (Give the forg a hat! Maybe have multiple hats to choose from!)

- Flies say something ("ow" when they're eaten, "HAHA" when they're not. HAHA from Nelson Muntz)

- Fun fact when lose (A fun fact about frogs appears when you lose, so at least you learn something)
