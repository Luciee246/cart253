- A literal brainstorm (Many objects/emojis appear, only click the good ones tomake the storm in your brain subside. Storm worsens if you click the "exam" emoji for example)

- A piano you could play by using keys showing up (example: random numbers and letters you need to click that, over time, plays a melody)

- Many doors you need to open when the doorbell rings (only one door is the true exit)

- A horror escape room with a monster chasing you (Maybe sound activated, monster can hear you if you make noise irl)

- Food Vs. battles (Street fighter vibe, each food item has their own special power)

- Multi-tasking (All within the game, playing a game while also eating. The food can't get too cold, and you can't lose the game you're playing, or else you lose)

- An artwork that gets created when you play different music (artwork factors change depending on percussion, strings, voice, etc.)

- Selling charcuterie boards to mice (but also having mice in your kitchen that you need to shoo away because they will eat everything they see)

- Drawing accuracy (Gives you a well-known character, and you have to draw them from memory, the computer then tells you how accurate you were to the original)
