This is super cool!

I like that multiple flies show up at once, and that the tongue can catch them all instead of only catching one. It kind of makes this project “overwhelming” in a sense? But not in a bad way! It made me feel like “Okay, I need to keep clicking and moving the tongue fast so I can get as many points as I can.”

Because of the constant clicking to catch the flies, the game-over screen only showed up for a second before the game/next level restarted. It would be nice if the game state changed from “game-over” to “reset” with another button instead of a mouse click, so that you could see your score, etc.

I just replayed the game and saw that the frog’s body changes color based on whether you eat a gold or red fly, and that is so cool and creative. I really like the transparency when you eat the red fly; it makes the frog look sick, which is kinda cool, to be honest.

I couldn't find the new code you added, so my coding comments are based on what I see rather than the potential comments you added in your code.

The red and gold flies don’t show up on the same level. They alternate randomly, and I don’t know if that was the goal. If not, maybe add a randomness factor to have them alternate on the same level?

The title font size could be smaller; it bleeds onto the edges of the canvas. The “click anywhere to start” could also be another color, maybe a darker one; it was a little bit hard to see with the grass background.

Overall, it’s a super cool project and gave me some ideas I can implement in my future projects. :)

Wow, this is a lot harder than it looks!

I like the sound of the flies; it made it more stressful, and I like that.
Also, the flies moved insanely fast, and the mix of the sounds with the fast flies just makes this a rage game, which I love, so props to that!

I realized by looking at the code that you EAT THE START BUTTON TO START THE GAME, WHICH IS SO CREATIVE.

The coding you did to have the eyes follow the fly is super cool and very organized. I didn’t know how to code what you did, but I understood everything you wrote because it was so clear :) I’ll definitely be using that for future projects!

Once I think I figured out everything there is to do in this work, I find a lot more things to interact with :)

This was a super cool work. I think the color palette was interesting, and once again, the fact that you can interact with literally everything is super cool. I found the arm movement to be the coolest; it didn't move as fast as the cursor did, which made the arm animation look very smooth.

The only thing I would fix is that the words could be combined with the emojis so as not to cover your name when you bring the emojis up. 

The coding is super organized, and the comments are very clear. The function calls are also very clear. It’s Simple, Readable, And Easy Logic :)
